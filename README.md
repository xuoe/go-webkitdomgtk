go-webkitdomgtk
===============

Go bindings for [WebKitDOMGTK+](http://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkitdomgtk/stable).

I had this lying around and I thought someone out there could make use of it.
It's about 80% done and it will probably remain so unless someone decides to 
fork it. 

It's based on the [glib binding](https://github.com/conformal/gotk3) by Conformal.

## Installation

```sh
$ go get github.com/xuoe/go-webkitdomgtk
```
